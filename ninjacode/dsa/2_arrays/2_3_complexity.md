It helps us understand how the algorithm's performance changes as the size of the input data grows. One common way to express algorithmic complexity is by using something called “Big O notation.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/gp_dsa_arrays_complexity-introduction-0-1695370446.webp" alt="Time Complexity: Significance, Types, Algorithms"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let's break down the key concepts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Algorithm:</strong> This is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. In our example, sorting a list of numbers is the problem, and an algorithm like quicksort is the set of instructions to do it.</p><p><strong>2. Input Size</strong>: This is the amount of data your algorithm has to work with. For sorting algorithms, it would be the number of items in the list to be sorted. The input size can vary, and complexity analysis helps us understand how the algorithm behaves as the input size grows.</p><p><strong>3. Efficiency:</strong> We want our algorithms to be efficient, which means they should use as few resources (like time and memory) as possible. Complexity analysis helps us quantify this efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Big “O” notation:</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big O notation is a way to describe how the runtime (or memory usage) of an algorithm grows relative to the size of its input. It's represented using the letter "O" followed by an expression. This expression simplifies the algorithm's behavior into a general, easily understandable form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few common Big O notations and what they mean:</p><p>- <strong>O(1) -</strong> <strong>Constant Time:</strong> This means the algorithm's runtime doesn't depend on the input size. It's like saying, "no matter how many items you have to sort, it'll take the same amount of time."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- <strong>O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:</strong> As the input size grows, the algorithm's runtime grows, but it doesn't grow very quickly. It's like having a phonebook and being able to find a name quickly by splitting it in half repeatedly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-<strong> O(n) - Linear Time: </strong>The runtime of the algorithm grows linearly with the input size. If you double the input size, it will take roughly twice as long to run. It's like checking each item in a list one by one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- <strong>O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: </strong>The runtime of the algorithm grows with the square of the input size. If you double the input size, it will take about four times as long to run. It's like nested loops that iterate over all pairs of items in a list.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/gp_dsa_arrays_complexity-introduction-0-1695369827.webp" alt="A Beginner's Guide to Big O Notation (Part 2) | by Alison Quaglia | The  Startup | Medium"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Big O notation is a way to compare different algorithms quickly.</strong> <strong>You want to choose an algorithm with the smallest possible Big O complexity for your specific problem to make it run efficiently, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.</strong></p></div>
