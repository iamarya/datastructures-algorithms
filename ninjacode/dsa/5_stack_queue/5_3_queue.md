One thing which is common to both the ATM and metro is that there is a line of people who wait for their turn to go inside the ATM building and also there is a line in the metro for security checking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">This line is often known as&nbsp;<strong>Queue.&nbsp;</strong>In computer Science, Queue is also a data structure which resembles similar operations like a stack.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">One thing of observation is that the person who is in the&nbsp;<strong>front</strong> of the line gets to visit the building&nbsp;<strong>first</strong> and then corresponding people are allowed.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-queues-0-1700465984.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Let us take an example of Queue data structure and represent it inside the computer memory.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-queues-1-1700465985.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">This represents a QUEUE in the computer memory.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;">Some Important Points about Queue -</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">In a queue, the data values are kept one after another. It is shown in the above picture that 14 is the&nbsp;<strong>front</strong> most element, then 18, then 57 and 23 is the&nbsp;<strong>rear</strong> most element.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">Queue follows the principle of&nbsp;<strong>FIFO (FIrst In First Out).&nbsp;</strong>It means the element which is put inside the queue for the first time or most firstly will be taken back firstly. In the above example, 14 is pushed into the queue most firstly and will be popped most initially. We can also apply this principle in general examples as well. Just like a person in the front gets the first chance to enter the ATM building and then corresponding people. More like a&nbsp;<strong>first come first serve basis.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">Also, the element which is kept inside the queue for the last time will be accessed lastly. In the example, 23 is popped for the last time in the queue because it will be accessed only if all the front elements are popped. Thus 23 will be accessed lastly.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">The different operations in the queue are -&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ul><li><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>PUSH -&nbsp;</strong>PUSH means to add an element in the queue. The new element will come at the rear side of the queue. The size of the queue&nbsp;<strong>increases</strong> by 1. There will&nbsp;<strong>be no</strong> change in the front element.</span></p></li></ul><p style="margin-left:72pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-queues-2-1700465985.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>POP -&nbsp;</strong>POP means to remove an element from the queue. Obviously, the front most element will only be removed. The size of the stack&nbsp;<strong>decreases</strong> by 1. There will&nbsp;<strong>be</strong> change in the front element.</span></p></li></ul><p style="margin-left:72pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-queues-3-1700465985.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>FRONT -&nbsp;</strong>FRONT means to get the value of the front most element of the queue. If the queue is empty, there will be no front element.&nbsp;<strong>14&nbsp;</strong>is the front most element of the shown queue.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>SIZE -&nbsp;</strong>SIZE gives us the count of elements in the queue. If the queue is empty, the size will be 0. The size of the shown queue is&nbsp;<strong>4.</strong></span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>EMPTY -&nbsp;EMPTY gives us a&nbsp;boolean value. It is true when the queue is empty and false otherwise. The above queue will give us the value&nbsp;false,&nbsp;because the queue is not empty.</strong></span></p></li></ul><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>The time complexity of all the above operations is constant. O(1)</strong></span></p></div>
