Thus there are two internal parts of graph -&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Nodes -&nbsp;which stores the data.</strong></span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Edges -&nbsp;which is used to connect two or more nodes.</strong></span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Types of Edges -&nbsp;</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Undirected Edge -&nbsp;These are bidirectional edges. If nodes A and B are connected by undirected edges, we can travel either to node A from node B or vice versa.</strong></span></li></ul><p style="margin-left:36pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-graphs-dsa-new-0-1702720056.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Directed Edge -&nbsp;These are unidirectional edges. We can only travel to one node from the other node but not in the reverse direction.</strong></span><strong><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-graphs-dsa-new-1-1702720057.webp"></strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Connected Components of Graph -&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The connected components of a graph are defined as the different regions of the graph. The properties of a region are -&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">A region can contain any number of nodes and edges.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">All the nodes are connected in a region. It means starting from any node, you can reach any other node via a path.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">Nodes of two different regions can not be connected together.</span></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>For Example -&nbsp;</strong>Consider a graph with 7 nodes. There are 3 regions in the given graph.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-graphs-dsa-new-2-1702720057.webp"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Types of Graph -&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Connected Graph</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">A connected graph is the one which has only 1 connected component.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong>Disconnected Graph</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">A disconnected graph is the one which contains more than 1 connected component. Since, different components are not connected, this graph is called a disconnected graph.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Degree of a Node -</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The degree of a node is defined as the number of edges that are incident to it. If the degree of vertex u is 0, it means that u does not belong to any edge and such a node is known as an&nbsp;<strong>isolated vertex.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Self Loop</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">A self loop is that edge which connects the same node to itself. For example - if node A is connected to node A via an edge, it is called self loop.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:11pt;"><img src="https://files.codingninjas.in/article_images/introduction-to-graphs-dsa-new-3-1702720057.jpg"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:13.999999999999998pt;"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><strong> -&nbsp;</strong>Usually the nodes are numbered in two conventions -&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">From 0 to n-1.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:11pt;">From 1 to n.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Where ‘n’ is the number of nodes in the graph.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
